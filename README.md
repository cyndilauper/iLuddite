# iLuddite
iLuddite is a Makersquare Greenfield project created by Brittany Artimez, Michael Lefkowitz, Stephen Bolton, Joey Steinburger, and Rachel DePriest. Our application is meant for anybody who loves to read, but wants a more social experience for a traditionally solo exercise.  

##Authorization and Account Creation 
Before creating an account with iLuddite, we require that all potential users have an active Facebook account. This allows for us to gather the users profile picture, name, and friends that use iLuddite. In addition this allows for an easy authorization process for both the user and the developers.
